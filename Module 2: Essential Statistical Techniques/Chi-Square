# What is a chi-square test?


Chi-square tests, specifically Pearson’s chi-square (Χ2) tests, are widely employed as nonparametric tests. Nonparametric tests are chosen for data that deviate from the assumptions of parametric tests, particularly the assumption of a normal distribution.

When examining a hypothesis related to the distribution of a categorical variable, it is essential to utilize a chi-square test or another nonparametric test. Categorical variables, whether nominal or ordinal, delineate groupings like species or nationalities. Due to their limited, distinct values, categorical variables do not conform to a normal distribution.

# What is a chi-square test?


Chi-square tests, specifically Pearson’s chi-square (Χ2) tests, are widely employed as nonparametric tests. Nonparametric tests are chosen for data that deviate from the assumptions of parametric tests, particularly the assumption of a normal distribution.

When examining a hypothesis related to the distribution of a categorical variable, it is essential to utilize a chi-square test or another nonparametric test. Categorical variables, whether nominal or ordinal, delineate groupings like species or nationalities. Due to their limited, distinct values, categorical variables do not conform to a normal distribution.

# When to Use a Chi-Square test


The application of a chi-square test, specifically Pearson's chi-square, is suitable for your data under the following conditions:

1. Your objective is to test a hypothesis concerning one or more categorical variables. If any of your variables are quantitative, opting for a different statistical test is advisable. Alternatively, you can transform the quantitative variable into a categorical one by dividing the observations into intervals.

2. The sample has been randomly chosen from the population.

3. Each group or combination of groups should anticipate a minimum of five expected observations.


# Type of Chi-Square tests
There are two types of Pearson's chi-square tests:

1. Chi-square goodness of fit test
2. Chi-square test of independence
Mathematically, these tests are identical. However, they are commonly perceived as distinct because of their varied applications.

## Chi-square goodness of fit test
This test is employed when dealing with a single categorical variable. It enables the examination of whether the frequency distribution of the categorical variable significantly deviates from the expected distribution. The expectation, although not always, is frequently based on the assumption that the categories will exhibit equal proportions.

# What is Logistic Regression?
The Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a binary dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It's commonly used when the dependent variable represents a categorical outcome with two possible values (e.g., yes/no, success/failure, 0/1).

# Assumptions of Logistic Regression
* The dependent variable should be dichotomous in nature, meaning it only has two possible outcomes.
* There should be no outliers in the data
* There should be no high correlations (multicollinearity) among the predictors.

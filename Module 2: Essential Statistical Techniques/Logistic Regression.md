# What is Logistic Regression?
The Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a binary dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It's commonly used when the dependent variable represents a categorical outcome with two possible values (e.g., yes/no, success/failure, 0/1).

# Assumptions of Logistic Regression
* The dependent variable should be dichotomous in nature, meaning it only has two possible outcomes.
* There should be no outliers in the data
* There should be no high correlations (multicollinearity) among the predictors.

Logistic regression, similar to linear regression, employs the conventional regression formula within the logistic function of e^x / (1 + e^x). Consequently, this logistic function introduces an altered interpretation of coefficients.

Graphically, while linear regression entails fitting a straight line, logistic regression (probabilities) entails fitting a curved line between zero and one. Observe in the illustration below how the inputs (x-axis) remain consistent while the outputs (y-axis) demonstrate significant variation.

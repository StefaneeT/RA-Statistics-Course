# Introduction to the Concept of ANOVA

Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical test used to analyze the difference between the means of more than two groups.

A two-way ANOVA is used to estimate how the mean of a quantitative variable changes according to the levels of two categorical variables. Use a two-way ANOVA when you want to know how **two independent variables**, in combination, affect a dependent variable.

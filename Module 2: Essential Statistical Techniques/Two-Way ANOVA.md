# Introduction to the Concept of ANOVA

Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical test used to analyze the difference between the means of more than two groups.

A two-way ANOVA is used to estimate how the mean of a quantitative variable changes according to the levels of two categorical variables. Use a two-way ANOVA when you want to know how **two independent variables**, in combination, affect a dependent variable.

# Two-Way ANOVA Example
Let's consider an example where you want to investigate the effects of both the type of support system (family, friends, professional counseling) and the gender of individuals on mental health outcomes in LGBTQIA individuals. In this case, you have two independent variables: support system and gender.

Your aim is to explore whether there are significant differences in mental health scores based on both the type of support system and gender, and if there is any interaction effect between these two factors.

The null hypothesis (H0) asserts that there is no substantial difference among group means, and there is no interaction effect between the two independent variables.

The alternative hypothesis (Ha) is that at least one group significantly deviates from the overall mean of the dependent variable (mental health scores), and there might be an interaction effect between the two independent variables.

# When should you use a Two-Way ANOVA?
Utilize a two-way ANOVA when you have data related to two categorical independent variables and one quantitative dependent variable. The independent variables should encompass at least two levels each, forming distinct groups or categories.

Two-Way ANOVA aids in discerning whether the dependent variable exhibits variations based on the levels of both independent variables and if there is an interaction effect between them.

ANOVA assumptions for two-way ANOVA are similar to those of one-way ANOVA: independence, normal distribution, and homogeneity of variance within each group.

# Mathematical Foundation for Two-Way ANOVA
The formula for the F-statistic in two-way ANOVA involves Mean Squares for both factors (independent variables) and their interaction, similar to the one-way ANOVA.

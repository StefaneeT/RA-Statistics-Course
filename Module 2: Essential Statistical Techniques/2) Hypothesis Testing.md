|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Null Hypothesis (H0)   | The statement or claim being made (which we are trying to disprove                      |
| Alternate Hypothesis   | The statement that the researcher is trying to find evidence to support                                |
| Type I Error           | Rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true                                           |
| Type II Error          | Failing to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true                             |
| Test Statistics (t)    | A single number that summarizes the sample data used to conduct the test hypothesis                   |
| Standard Error         | How far sample statistics (e.g., mean) deviates from the actual population mean                        |
| p-value                | Probability of observing a test statistics, assuming that the null hypothesis is true                                                         |
| Significance level (α) | Probability of making Type I error                                                                    |
| One tailed test        | Test statistics falls into one specified tail of its sampling distribution                            |
| Two tailed test        | Test statistics can fall into either tail of its sampling distribution                                |

# What is a chi-square test?


Chi-square tests, specifically Pearson’s chi-square (Χ2) tests, are widely employed as nonparametric tests. Nonparametric tests are chosen for data that deviate from the assumptions of parametric tests, particularly the assumption of a normal distribution.

When examining a hypothesis related to the distribution of a categorical variable, it is essential to utilize a chi-square test or another nonparametric test. Categorical variables, whether nominal or ordinal, delineate groupings like species or nationalities. Due to their limited, distinct values, categorical variables do not conform to a normal distribution.

# When to Use a Chi-Square test


The application of a chi-square test, specifically Pearson's chi-square, is suitable for your data under the following conditions:

1. Your objective is to test a hypothesis concerning one or more categorical variables. If any of your variables are quantitative, opting for a different statistical test is advisable. Alternatively, you can transform the quantitative variable into a categorical one by dividing the observations into intervals.

2. The sample has been randomly chosen from the population.

3. Each group or combination of groups should anticipate a minimum of five expected observations.


# Type of Chi-Square tests
There are two types of Pearson's chi-square tests:

1. Chi-square goodness of fit test
2. Chi-square test of independence
Mathematically, these tests are identical. However, they are commonly perceived as distinct because of their varied applications.

## Chi-square goodness of fit test
This test is employed when dealing with a single categorical variable. It enables the examination of whether the frequency distribution of the categorical variable significantly deviates from the expected distribution. The expectation, although not always, is frequently based on the assumption that the categories will exhibit equal proportions.

## Chi-square test of independence
The chi-square test of independence is applicable when dealing with two categorical variables. It enables the examination of the relationship between these two variables. In the case of independence, the probability of belonging to a particular group for one variable remains unaffected by the presence of the other variable.


# Guidelines for Conducting a Chi-Square Test

Executing a chi-square test, whether Pearson’s or otherwise, involves several key steps tailored to the specific test being employed:

1. Construct a table presenting observed and expected frequencies, a pivotal step often demanding meticulous consideration to determine the most suitable expected values aligning with your null hypothesis.
2. Compute the chi-square value utilizing the observed and expected frequencies through the chi-square formula.
3. Obtain the critical chi-square value either from a chi-square critical value table or via statistical software.
4. Compare the computed chi-square value with the critical value to show the larger of the two.
5. Determine whether to reject the null hypothesis, leaning towards rejection if the chi-square value surpasses the critical value, signifying a significant deviation from anticipated data patterns.

# Reporting a Chi-Square Test in Research

* Omit formula citations as the chi-square test stands as a widely recognized statistical measure.
* Refer to chi-square employing its Greek symbol, Χ², distinct from the Latin alphabet's "X" and should remain unitalicized.
* If the chi-square value is negative, utilize a leading zero before the decimal point.
* Maintain two significant digits after the decimal point.
* Present the chi-square alongside its degrees of freedom, sample size, and p-value following this format: Χ² (degrees of freedom, N = sample size) = chi-square value, p = p-value.

Example: There was no significant relationship between healthcare utilization and nationality, Χ² (1, N = 428) = 0.44, p = .505.

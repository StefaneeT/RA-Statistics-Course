# Chi-square test or Fisher exact test:
For tests where both the variables are categorical like chi-square test and fisher-exact test, bar-charts are most commonly used.

For example: Let us visualize the frequency of car brands in a class of students according to gender

# Correlation:
For Pearson correlation, where both the variables are continuous, scatter plot with regression line is best to visualize the data.

# T-test or One-way ANOVA:
Since t-test (independent t-test and paired t-test) and one-way ANOVA are used to assess the mean (Â± SD) difference between the groups, plot with error bars is the best for representing these tests. Box-plot is also commonly used for visualizing t-test and one-way ANOVA.

# Mann-Whitney U test or paired samples Wilcoxon test or Kruskal-Wallis test:
Mann-Whitney test, paired samples Wilcoxon test and Kruskal-Wallis test are non-parametric alternatives of independent t-test, paired t-test and one-way ANOVA respectively.
In these tests, variables are usually expressed as median (interquartile range); therefore boxplots are a good data visualization technique for these tests. In the box-plot, we can visualize median, interquartile range (i.e. 1st quartile and 3rd quartile), minimum and maximum. Since non-parametric tests like Mann-Whitney test, paired samples Wilcoxon test and Kruskal-Wallis test are used to assess difference in spread of variables between groups, box-plot is the best option.

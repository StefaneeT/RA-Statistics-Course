# Bar Chart:
For tests where both the variables are categorical like chi-square test and fisher-exact test, bar-charts are most commonly used.

For example: A bar chart could be used to visualize the frequency of car brands in a class of students according to gender

## Bar chart vs. Histogram
A bar chart and a histogram are both types of graphical representations of data, but they are used to display different types of information.

A bar chart is used to represent discrete data, where the data is divided into separate categories. The height of each bar represents the frequency or quantity of the data that falls into that category.

A histogram, on the other hand, is used to represent continuous data, where the data is divided into a set of bins or intervals. The height of each bar represents the frequency or quantity of the data that falls into that bin or interval. The bars in a histogram are usually adjacent and there is no space between them.

The main difference between a bar chart and a histogram is the type of data they represent and the way the data is divided and displayed. Histograms are used for metric variables such as salary or age, and bar charts for ordinal or nominal variables such as gender or school grade.

# Histogram

A histogram is a graphical representation of data distribution. It uses bars of varying heights to show the frequency of data items in successive numerical intervals. The height of a bar corresponds to the frequency of data in that range.

For example: A histogram would be used to visualize the results of a exam scores of students.

# Correlation:
For Pearson correlation, where both the variables are continuous, scatter plot with regression line is best to visualize the data.

For example: A scatterplot with a regression line can be used to visualize the points of individuals asked for their weight and height.

# Boxplots:
Box-plot is also commonly used for visualizing t-test and one-way ANOVA. Box plots are charts used to represent distributions of data. They provide a visual summary of the data by presenting important statistical measures such as median, quartiles, and outliers in a single graph. Since t-test (independent t-test and paired t-test) and one-way ANOVA are used to assess the mean (Â± SD) difference between the groups, a boxplot with error bars is the best for representing these tests. In addition, Mann-Whitney test, paired samples Wilcoxon test and Kruskal-Wallis test are non-parametric alternatives of independent t-test, paired t-test and one-way ANOVA respectively. In these tests, variables are usually expressed as median (interquartile range); therefore boxplots are a good data visualization technique for these tests. In the box-plot, we can visualize median, interquartile range (i.e. 1st quartile and 3rd quartile), minimum and maximum. Since non-parametric tests like Mann-Whitney test, paired samples Wilcoxon test and Kruskal-Wallis test are used to assess difference in spread of variables between groups, box-plot is the best option.

For example: A boxplot could be used to observe the Body-Mass Index amongst genders (boxplot without error bars)

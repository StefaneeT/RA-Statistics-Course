# Introduction to the Concept of ANOVA

Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical examination used to assess variations among the means of multiple groups.
In the context of ANOVA, a one-way test involves a single independent variable, whereas a two-way ANOVA involves two independent variables.

# ANOVA Example

As a researcher in maternal health for black women outcomes, you may want to investigate the impact of three different healthcare interventions on maternal health outcomes. You can use a one-way ANOVA to determine whether there are significant differences in maternal health outcomes among the three intervention groups. This statistical analysis can help identify potential disparities and the effectiveness of different interventions in improving maternal health for black women.

# When should you use a One-Way ANOVA?

Utilize a one-way ANOVA when you have data related to one categorical independent variable and one quantitative dependent variable. The independent variable should encompass a minimum of three levels, which represents distinct groups or categories.

ANOVA aids in discerning whether the dependent variable exhibits variations based on the levels of the independent variable.

In the context of maternal health for black women example, the independent variable could be healthcare interventions, which could be categorized into low, medium, and high levels to investigate potential differences in maternal health outcomes.
The null hypothesis (H0) in ANOVA is that there is no disparity among group means.
The alternative hypothesis (Ha) suggests that at least one group significantly deviates from the overall mean of the dependent variable.

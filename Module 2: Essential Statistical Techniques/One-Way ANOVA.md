# Introduction to the Concept of ANOVA

Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical examination used to assess variations among the means of multiple groups.
In the context of ANOVA, a one-way test involves a single independent variable, whereas a two-way ANOVA involves two independent variables.

# ANOVA Example

As a researcher in maternal health for black women outcomes, you may want to investigate the impact of three different healthcare interventions on maternal health outcomes. You can use a one-way ANOVA to determine whether there are significant differences in maternal health outcomes among the three intervention groups. This statistical analysis can help identify potential disparities and the effectiveness of different interventions in improving maternal health for black women.

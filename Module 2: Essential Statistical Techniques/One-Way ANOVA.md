# Introduction to the Concept of ANOVA

Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical examination used to assess variations among the means of multiple groups.
In the context of ANOVA, a one-way test involves a single independent variable, whereas a two-way ANOVA involves two independent variables.

# ANOVA Example

You want to examine if the type of support system (family, friends, professional counseling) influence the mental health outcomes of LGBTQIA individuals, and if there are significant differences in mental health scores among these groups.

Your independent variable is the type of support system (family, friends, professional counseling), and you categorize individuals into groups based on the level of support they receive. The aim is to investigate potential differences in mental health scores among LGBTQIA individuals based on the type of support they have.
The null hypothesis (H0) asserts that there is no substantial difference among group means.

The alternative hypothesis (Ha) is that at least one group significantly deviates from the overall mean of the dependent variable (mental health scores).

# When should you use a One-Way ANOVA?

Utilize a one-way ANOVA when you have data related to one categorical independent variable and one quantitative dependent variable. The independent variable should encompass a minimum of three levels, which represents distinct groups or categories.

ANOVA aids in discerning whether the dependent variable exhibits variations based on the levels of the independent variable.

In the context of maternal health for black women example, the independent variable could be healthcare interventions, which could be categorized into low, medium, and high levels to investigate potential differences in maternal health outcomes.
The null hypothesis (H0) in ANOVA is that there is no disparity among group means.
The alternative hypothesis (Ha) suggests that at least one group significantly deviates from the overall mean of the dependent variable.

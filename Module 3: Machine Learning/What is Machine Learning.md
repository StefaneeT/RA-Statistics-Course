# What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a set of methods utilized by computer scientists to train computers on learning processes. Rather than giving commands through programming, they present problems for the computers to solve along with many examples for learning purposes.

Consider a scenario where a computer is tasked with distinguishing between images of flowers and images of bicycles. While humans may find this task straightforward, for a computer compiling a list of all the distinctive characteristics of flowers and bicycles would be exceedingly challenging. Similarly, if we had to trace all the mental steps we used to complete this task it would also pose difficulties, as it's largely an automatic process for adults, potentially missing crucial steps or details.

Instead, machine learning operates similarly to the learning process of toddlers: by exposing the computer to a vast array of labeled images—some tagged as "flower" and others as "bicycle"—the computer discerns the features that define a flower or a bicycle. As a result, the computer becomes adept at identifying flowers and bicycles in images it has not encountered during its training phase.

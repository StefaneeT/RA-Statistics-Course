# What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning has the involvment of a human "guide" that provides labeled, annotated data or instances comprising problem-solution pairs to the computer.

## Supervised learning example:

Consider training a computer to differentiate between images of cars and images of bicycles.

In supervised learning, an expert would classify a database of images, labeling each as either "car" or "bicycle." Subsequently, this annotated dataset would be fed into the computer, enabling it to autonomously detect the distinguishing features of cars and bicycles.
Supervised learning has a goal to interpret data within the framework of a specific inquiry or issue (e.g., "detect images of cars"). By presenting the computer with abundant examples (in this instance, images) alongside the correct classifications (i.e., whether the image depicts a car or a bicycle), the computer learns to correctly categorize the data.

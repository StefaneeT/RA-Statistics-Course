# What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning has the involvement of a human "guide" that provides labeled, annotated data or instances comprising problem-solution pairs to the computer. 
In the previous lessons, we discussed simple linear regression and logistic regression which are also examples of supervised learning.

## Supervised learning example:

Consider training a computer to differentiate between images of cars and images of bicycles.

In supervised learning, an expert would classify a database of images, labeling each as either "car" or "bicycle." Subsequently, this annotated dataset would be fed into the computer, enabling it to autonomously detect the distinguishing features of cars and bicycles.
Supervised learning has a goal to interpret data within the framework of a specific inquiry or issue (e.g., "detect images of cars"). By presenting the computer with abundant examples (in this instance, images) alongside the correct classifications (i.e., whether the image depicts a car or a bicycle), the computer learns to correctly categorize the data.


# Supervised Machine Learning Methods

Supervised machine learning serves two primary types of methods:

1. Classification: Involves categorizing data into distinct classes or categories.
2. Regression: Explores the relationship between dependent and independent variables.

Both classification and regression rely on labeled datasets for prediction purposes, yet they differ in the nature of the output they aim to predict.

## Classification

Classification aims to assign input data to predefined classes or categories through training with labeled data. By detecting distinctive features or traits associated with each class, the computer learns to differentiate among them.

For example, in image classification, the objective might involve identifying objects within an image. Similarly, classification can predict discrete outcomes, such as determining whether it will rain on a particular day.

### Examples of classification problems include:

* Handwritten character and numeral recognition
* Fraud detection (e.g., identifying suspicious bank transactions)
* Email spam detection

## Regression

Regression involves forecasting numerical values rather than categories. Predicted outcomes in regression are real values, such as the anticipated price of a house based on factors like square footage or location. 

### Examples of regression problems include:

* Predicting future stock values
* Energy consumption prediction
* Salary estimation
  
In both regression and classification, the objective is to uncover specific relationships or patterns within the input data, enabling the computer to generate accurate output data effectively.

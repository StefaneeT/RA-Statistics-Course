# What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a set of methods utilized by computer scientists to train computers on learning processes. Rather than giving commands through programming, they present problems for the computers to solve along with many examples for learning purposes.

Consider a scenario where a computer is tasked with distinguishing between images of flowers and images of bicycles. While humans may find this task straightforward, for a computer compiling a list of all the distinctive characteristics of flowers and bicycles would be exceedingly challenging. Similarly, if we had to trace all the mental steps we used to complete this task it would also pose difficulties, as it's largely an automatic process for adults, potentially missing crucial steps or details.

Instead, machine learning operates similarly to the learning process of toddlers: by exposing the computer to a vast array of labeled images—some tagged as "flower" and others as "bicycle"—the computer discerns the features that define a flower or a bicycle. As a result, the computer becomes adept at identifying flowers and bicycles in images it has not encountered during its training phase.

# Advantages and Limitations

Machine learning stands as a powerful problem-solving tool; however, it still holds limitations. Below are the primary benefits and ongoing challenges associated with machine learning:

## Advantages:

* Data Scalability: Machine learning excels at handling issues that demand the processing of extensive datasets. 
* Adaptability: Machine learning models can assimilate new data and continually refine their accuracy with time. 
* Automation: Machine learning models streamline manual data analysis and interpretation, ultimately automating decision-making processes. 

## Limitations:

* Overfitting and Generalization Challenges: Over-reliance on training data can lead to overfitting, this means it cannot generalize to examples it hasn’t encountered before . 
* Explainability: Certain machine learning models cannot be explained, even experts have challenges in explaining their decision-making rationale. 
* Algorithmic Bias: Machine learning models learn from human-generated data, which may be tainted with bias and unrepresentative information.

# Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning
Machine learning and deep learning are both subfields within artificial intelligence, with deep learning falling under the umbrella of machine learning. Here are the main differences between the two:

* **Machine learning** requires human intervention, where experts annotate data and identify defining characteristics. The algorithm can then use these extracted characteristics or features to create a model

* **Deep learning** operates without the dependency of annotated datasets. It possesses the capability to analyze unstructured data, such as images or textual content, and can automatically determine relevant features that are important for categorizing data into distinct classes.

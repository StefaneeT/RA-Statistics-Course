# What is Regression Analysis?

Regression analysis is a type of predictive modeling technique used to investigate the relationship between a dataset's dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This method is commonly applied in cases where the dependent and independent variables are connected, either linearly or non-linearly, and where the target variable consists of continuous values. Regression models are instrumental in identifying causal relationships between variables, analyzing time series data, and making predictions. For instance, they are ideally suited for exploring how sales might vary in response to changes in advertising spending for a company.

# What is the Purpose of Regression Models?

Regression analysis serves one of two primary purposes: predicting the dependent variable's value given information about the independent variables, or forecasting the impact of an independent variable on the dependent variable.

# Types of Regression Models
There is a wide array of regression analysis techniques available for predictive purposes. The selection of a specific method depends on several factors, such as the number of independent variables, the shape of the regression curve, and the nature of the dependent variable.

# What is Principal Component Analysis (PCA)?

Principal Component Analysis is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms data into a new coordinate system. It identifies the directions (principal components) that maximize the variance in the data.
PCA reduces the number of variables while retaining as much information as possible.

# When to Use

A Principal Component Analysis is use when you want to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset to make it easier to analyze and visualize. It is also useful for handling multicollinearity (highly correlated features) in regression models.
It is ideal for data compression, noise reduction, and data preprocessing before applying machine learning algorithms. It is also applicable when you want to identify patterns or trends in the data by observing how the data points cluster around certain axes and suitable for tasks like feature extraction and understanding which features contribute most to data variance.

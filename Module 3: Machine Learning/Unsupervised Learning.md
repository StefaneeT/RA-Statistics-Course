# What is Unsupervised Learning?

Unsupervised learning comes into play when there's no labeled data or clear instructions for the computer. Instead, the computer independently seeks out underlying patterns or structures within the data without any external guidance.

## Example of Unsupervised Learning
Suppose a media company has gathered a vast amount of articles from different sources covering various topics such as politics, sports, technology, and entertainment. Without any predefined labels indicating the topic of each article, unsupervised learning algorithms can be utilized to cluster similar articles together based on their content and language patterns.

By applying unsupervised learning techniques, the algorithm can autonomously identify common themes or topics across the articles and group them accordingly. This clustering allows the media company to gain insights into the overarching trends and interests within their content repository. Subsequently, this information can be leveraged to enhance content categorization, recommend related articles to readers, or even identify potential gaps in coverage for specific topics.

# Unsupervised Learning Methods
Unsupervised learning is used for three main tasks:

1. Clustering
2. Association
3. Dimensionality reduction
  
In each of these tasks, we want to discover the inherent structure of our data for which no predefined categories or labels exist.

# Clustering

Clustering is a method in machine learning used to categorize unlabeled data according to their similarities or dissimilarities. This technique allows us to uncover patterns within the data even when we lack prior knowledge about what we're seeking.

An illustration of clustering is organizing customers into distinct segments based on shared characteristics, similar to finding natural groupings within the data. Think of clustering as sorting a stack of books into different genres or topics without any prior information about the books. Each book is examined individually, and if they exhibit similarities, they are grouped together.

Examples of clustering problems include:
* Recommendation systems: Grouping users or items with similar preferences or characteristics to make personalized recommendations for products, movies, or music
* Image compression: Reducing the size of an image by grouping similar pixels together
* Social network analysis: Identifying communities or groups within social networks based on connections and interactions between individuals
* Anomaly detection: Detecting abnormal behavior, such as network intrusions or suspicious bank transactions

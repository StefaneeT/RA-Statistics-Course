# What is Unsupervised Learning?

Unsupervised learning comes into play when there's no labeled data or clear instructions for the computer. Instead, the computer independently seeks out underlying patterns or structures within the data without any external guidance.

## Example of Unsupervised Learning
Suppose a media company has gathered a vast amount of articles from different sources covering various topics such as politics, sports, technology, and entertainment. Without any predefined labels indicating the topic of each article, unsupervised learning algorithms can be utilized to cluster similar articles together based on their content and language patterns.

By applying unsupervised learning techniques, the algorithm can autonomously identify common themes or topics across the articles and group them accordingly. This clustering allows the media company to gain insights into the overarching trends and interests within their content repository. Subsequently, this information can be leveraged to enhance content categorization, recommend related articles to readers, or even identify potential gaps in coverage for specific topics.

# Unsupervised Learning Methods
Unsupervised learning is used for three main tasks:

1. Clustering
2. Association
3. Dimensionality reduction
  
In each of these tasks, we want to discover the inherent structure of our data for which no predefined categories or labels exist.
